# Admin / Observability / Governance Layer Goals

## Phase Objectives
- Produce contract-valid outputs for downstream phases.
- Preserve provenance and tenant boundaries.
- Maintain deterministic behavior for replay.

## Must Hold True
- Inputs are validated against explicit contract versions.
- Outputs are versioned and lineage-linked.
- Failures produce diagnosable artifacts, not silent drops.

## Explicit Anti-Goals
- No business reasoning logic
- No direct mutation of domain truth without policy path
- No untracked manual overrides
